[See original implementation repo for more details.](https://github.com/affinelayer/pix2pix-tensorflow)

Experimenting with brain lesion segmentation with neural networks using pix2pix.

Run the commands in the included setup.sh and run.sh to train the model, which takes a few hours depending on your hardware setup. (about 3 hours with a GTX 980 Ti using default settings)

Test results from a previous run are available in the mritestoutput2/ directory.
